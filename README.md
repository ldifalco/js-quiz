Welcome to my Javascript Quiz

For this project, I was meant to make a functional quiz with questions based on javascript.  The quiz is meant to have a timer that includes a penalty for wrong answers, one question on the page at a time, and a high score page linked to local storage so the scores are saved, using js and JSON. When start is clicked, the timer begins going down.  When an answer to a question is selected, the next question is shown.  When all of the quesions are answered, or the timer runs out, the game is over.

This assignment was especially challenging for me, and will continue to be a work in progress until I can get this perfectly correct.  I will continue to update the code to get it exactly to the specifications laid out in the inital readme.
